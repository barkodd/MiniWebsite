                Spearhead forces and still have leftover models.</strong
              >
              Combined with the game board, terrain, and the Fire & Jade book,
              you have all the essentials to play the new Spearhead game mode.
              This makes Skaventide the most comprehensive starter box to date,
              providing a full gaming experience beyond just introductory
              scenarios. The only thing missing is a few dice.

              >It begins with an 8-page introduction to the hobby and moves into
              an extensive lore section. The ongoing narrative surrounding the
              Vermindoom is depicted with large-format artworks and sketch-like
              illustrations.

              letters, and notes. The history section covers the Age of Myth,
              Age of Chaos, Realmgate Wars, Soul Wars, and the Era of the Beast
              in about 20 pages. Nearly 100 pages introduce all factions, with
              each Grand Alliance given several pages of model photos and each
              faction a double-page spread of text and artwork.

              The rules section of the Warhammer Age of Sigmar 4th Edition Core
              Book includes core rules, advanced rules, the Path to Glory:
              Ascension campaign battlepack, the Matched Play: First Blood
              battlepack, and a glossary.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >The core rules span 22 pages with numbered paragraphs.</strong
              >
              The writing is precise but convoluted, as usual for Games
              Workshop. Summaries in red boxes and designer's notes in grey
              boxes help, and the graphics and diagrams are clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Then follow the advanced rules on just 13 pages.</strong>
              The advanced rules cover commands, terrain, magic, army
              composition, command models, and battle tactics
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Matched Play section is 3 pages long</strong> with three
              simple battleplans, suggesting the General's Handbook for more
              detailed play.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Spanning 30 pages, Path To Glory Battlepack</strong>
              offers a complete campaign system with 6 battleplans and 6 quests.
              Heroes can follow various paths to gain abilities, and non-hero
              units can gain experience.
            </p>
            <p class="part-heading">Takeaways</p>
            <p>
              The 4th edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar introduces significant
              changes to the rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Colour-Coded Phases: Each phase of a turn is assigned a specific
                colour, with actions and unit abilities classified and
                colour-coded accordingly. Icons indicate the type of ability,
                providing clarity and intuitiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modular Rules: The rules are divided into modular components.
                For example, Spearhead uses only core rules and its battlepack,
                while Path to Glory uses advanced rules but not battle tactics.
                The General's Handbook adds season rules.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The modular structure is a positive step, simplifying rules and
              communication. However, the Core Book lacks detailed explanations
              of this approach, which is its main weakness.
